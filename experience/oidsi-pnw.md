# OIDSI-PNW Website

**Role:** Full-stack Web Developer  
**Dates:** 2024 â€“ 2025  
**Stack:** Vue 3, Vite, Bootstrap 5, TypeScript, Playwright (e2e), GitHub Actions, AWS S3 + CloudFront

## Overview

The OIDSI-PNW site is a single-page application built with Vue and Vite. It was migrated from Firebase Hosting to **AWS S3 + CloudFront**, ensuring global caching and stable SPA routing. The project emphasizes accessibility, performance, and automated testing.

## Highlights

- Migrated deployment pipeline to **AWS S3 + CloudFront**, configured SPA routing fallback for deep links.
- Added **end-to-end testing with Playwright**; current suite passing on main.
- Customized Bootstrap theme using Sass `@use`, modernizing styles and removing deprecated imports.
- Fixed mobile navbar accessibility issues and improved ARIA usage for dropdowns.

## Technical Details

- **Frontend:** Vue 3 Composition API, Vue Router, Bootstrap 5 with custom Sass tokens.
- **Testing:** Playwright end-to-end test suite; CI runs on pull requests and main branch.
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions builds and deploys to AWS S3, with CloudFront invalidation for cache consistency.
- **Accessibility:** Keyboard navigation, focus ring adjustments, color contrast fixes, and mobile dropdown toggle improvements.

## Challenges & Solutions

- **Problem:** Direct navigation to routes (e.g. `/about`, `/gallery`) failed with 403/404 errors on static hosting.  
  **Solution:** Implemented SPA fallback (`index.html` copied to `404.html`) and CloudFront behavior rules.
