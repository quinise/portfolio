# Accord365 Internship

**Role:** Engineering Intern  
**Dates:** June 2020 - March 2021
**Stack:** Go (Buffalo, Gin), PostgreSQL, MySQL, Solidity, JavaScript, jQuery, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Truffle-Contracts, Web3.js, OAuth2

## Overview

As an engineering intern on the **Accord365** project, I contributed to both backend and frontend development, database design, blockchain integration, and client engagement. I co-facilitated the projectâ€™s focus group, created a wireframe, and worked closely with the client to refine requirements and validate progress.

## Highlights

- **Client Collaboration:**
  - Co-facilitated a two-part focus group with the client.
  - Created study forms, drafted questions, and took notes.
  - Consulted regularly with the client to review progress and debrief functionality.
- **Design:**
  - Created a full wireframe for the project using Sketch.
- **Backend Development:**
  - Built and updated PostgreSQL and MySQL databases; created models and wrote create/update queries.
  - Implemented both **Buffalo** (Go frontend) and **Gin** (Go server) frameworks.
  - Added **OAuth2 authentication with Google** in Gin.
  - Implemented cookies and session handling in Gin.
- **Frontend Development:**
  - Built HTML templates for the Go/Gin server with JavaScript, jQuery, and Bootstrap.
  - Validated JavaScript forms using regular expressions.
- **Blockchain Development:**
  - Developed an **ERC-20/270 token buying site** using Solidity, JSON, and JavaScript.
  - Integrated **Web3.js** API calls for blockchain contract and transaction interactions.
  - Used **Truffle-Contracts** for contract management.
  - Created a wallet that users could load with Ether.
- **Testing:**
  - Tested blockchain interactions with **Ganache, Metamask, Geth**, and the Ethereum test networks **Rinkeby and Robsten**.
  - Verified form handling and wallet transactions.

## Challenges & Solutions

- **Routing problem in Go frameworks:** Reached out to peers and mentors for help and improved debugging approach.
- **Complexity of blockchain tooling:** Leveraged test networks and local tools (Ganache, Metamask) to validate transactions without risk.
- **Collaboration hurdles:** Coordinated with teammates on JavaScript and Go issues, and created internal documentation (e.g., _Accord365 Mobile Todo_ doc) to improve organization.

## Collaboration

- Paired with teammates on JavaScript and Go issues.
- Regularly interfaced with the client, ensuring transparency and alignment.
- Reached out for support on specific blockers (routing and architecture).
