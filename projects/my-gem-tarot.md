- Implemented **CoreData** to persist readings and support CRUD operations.  
- Developed and styled multiple views; bound data from models using Swift property wrappers.  
- Enabled navigation by tarot card suit and gem association.  

## Technical Details

- **Persistence:** CoreData integration for offline access and CRUD operations.  
- **Networking:** Async REST calls to Tarot Card Meanings API.
