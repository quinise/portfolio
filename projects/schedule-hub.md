# Schedule Hub App

**Role:** Full-stack Developer  
**Dates:** March 2025 - Present
**Stack:** Angular, TypeScript, Bootstrap, Spring Boot (Java), PostgreSQL

## Overview

The Schedule Hub is a booking system that integrates a full Angular frontend with a Spring Boot backend. It enables users to schedule appointments while enforcing conflict detection rules to prevent overlapping or invalid bookings.

## Highlights

- Built a **full-stack scheduling system** using Angular 19 and Spring Boot.
- Implemented **conflict detection logic** in the backend to enforce buffer rules for appointments and events.
- Designed Angular components for **calendar view** and **list view**, including admin-only features.
- Created shared filtering and form components to streamline appointment creation and editing.

## Technical Details

- **Frontend:** Angular 19 standalone components with Bootstrap styling; used FullCalendar for event views.
- **Backend:** Spring Boot services with PostgreSQL database; included `Appointment` and `Event` entities, DTOs, and repositories.
- **Conflict Handling:** Buffer enforcement logic implemented in `ScheduleConflictService` and validated in both frontend and backend.
- **Testing:** Unit tests with JUnit for backend services and Jasmine/Karma for Angular components.

## Challenges & Solutions

- **Problem:** Scheduling conflicts with overlapping times.
  **Solution:** Created a custom `ScheduleConflictService` with buffer enforcement rules, validated through both unit and integration tests.
